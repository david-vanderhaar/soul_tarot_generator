Building a Card.

Card Properties
Value: 0 - 14 (0 = Major Arcana, 1-10 = Number Card, 11-14 = Face Card
Suit: a string ('Suns', 'Chiefs', 'Swords', 'Gourds' etc.)
Description: based on suit, perhaps leverageing Tracery
Base Symbol: a node based on the card's suit (this node represents a shape that will be repeated in each major card slot),
Slots: number of slots based on card value (face cards and Major get 1 slot)
Connectors: nodes that connect slots
Elaborations (Decorations): minor slots that do not use the base symbol and are generally smaller.

A card is made of a number of nodes. Nodes should be placed semi-symmetrically (repeated along either x-axis, y-axis or both)
